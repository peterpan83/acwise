ACWISE is a software package developed for atmospheric correction of spaceborne hyperspectral WaterSat Imaging Spectrometer Experiment (WISE) images (https://catalogue.ogsl.ca/en/dataset/ca-cioos_65fe38af-baea-46cf-a0c6-e17145ce2f07).  In its current version (v0.1), it supports processing only Level 1G images, which are geo-referenced radiance data.
